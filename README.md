## 🔧 Architecture & Technical Details

### Text Extraction Method
- **Primary**: pdf2images with Tesseract OCR for Bengali text
- **Preprocessing**: Image enhancement and noise reduction for better OCR accuracy

### Chunking Strategy
- **Method**: Recursive character splitting with Bengali sentence awareness
- **Size**: 1000 characters with 150 character overlap
- **Separators**: Respects Bengali sentence boundaries (।) and context

### Embedding Model
- **Model**: `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`
- **Benefits**: Excellent multilingual support, balanced performance/accuracy
- **Dimensions**: 384-dimensional embeddings

### Similarity Method
- **Primary**: Cosine similarity with ChromaDB vector storage
- **Enhanced**: Hybrid search combining semantic and keyword matching
- **Thresholds**: Dynamic thresholds based on language detection

### Caching System
- **Smart Caching**: Automatically caches processed documents and embeddings
- **Cache Validation**: MD5 hash-based validation for file changes
- **Quick Reload**: Instant loading from cache on subsequent runs

## 🤔 Frequently Asked Questions (Q&A)

### **Q: What method or library did you use to extract the text, and why? Did you face any formatting challenges with the PDF content?**

**A:** I used **pdf2image** combined with **Tesseract OCR** for text extraction. The main reason was that many Bengali PDFs are image-based rather than text-based, making traditional PDF text extraction ineffective.

**Challenges faced:**
- Bengali character recognition accuracy was initially poor (~60-70%)
- Mixed English-Bengali text caused formatting issues
- OCR struggled with complex page layouts and tables
- Image quality significantly affected extraction accuracy

**Solutions implemented:**
- Added image preprocessing (noise reduction, contrast enhancement)
- Used language-specific Tesseract models (`tesseract-ocr-ben`)
- Implemented post-processing to clean OCR artifacts
- Added manual quality checks for critical sections

### **Q: What chunking strategy did you choose? Why do you think it works well for semantic retrieval?**

**A:** I implemented **recursive character splitting** with Bengali sentence awareness:
- **Chunk size:** 1000 characters with 150 character overlap
- **Separators:** Respects Bengali sentence boundaries (`।`) and paragraph breaks
- **Context preservation:** Overlap ensures important context isn't lost between chunks

**Why it works:**
- Bengali sentences are typically longer than English, so 1000 characters capture complete thoughts
- Sentence boundary respect prevents cutting off mid-sentence
- The overlap helps with queries that span multiple chunks
- Character-based approach handles mixed Bengali-English content better than word-based

**Issues still remaining:**
- Sometimes splits complex explanations across chunks
- Poetry and dialogue formatting can be problematic

---

### **Q: What embedding model did you use? Why did you choose it? How does it capture meaning?**

**A:** I chose **paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2** from SentenceTransformers.

**Reasons for selection:**
- Native Bengali and English support
- Good balance between accuracy and speed
- 384-dimensional embeddings (lighter than larger models)
- Proven performance on multilingual semantic similarity tasks

**How it captures meaning:**
- Creates dense vector representations that capture semantic relationships
- Similar concepts cluster together in vector space regardless of language
- Handles code-switching (Bengali-English mixed text) reasonably well

**Limitations encountered:**
- Sometimes struggles with very domain-specific Bengali literary terms
- Cross-lingual retrieval (English query → Bengali text) accuracy could be better (~75%)

---

### **Q: How are you comparing queries with stored chunks? Why did you choose this similarity method?**

**A:** I use **cosine similarity** with **ChromaDB** as the vector store, enhanced with hybrid search.

**Implementation details:**
- Primary: Cosine similarity for semantic matching
- Secondary: Keyword matching for exact term queries
- Dynamic thresholds based on detected language (Bengali vs English)
- Top-k retrieval with relevance score filtering

**Why cosine similarity:**
- Works well with normalized embeddings
- Computationally efficient
- Handles varying text lengths well
- ChromaDB provides optimized similarity search

**Hybrid approach benefits:**
- Catches queries where semantic search misses exact terms
- Better handles proper nouns and specific terminology

---

### **Q: How do you ensure meaningful comparison between questions and chunks? What happens with vague queries?**

**A:** Several strategies are implemented:

**Query processing:**
- Language detection to apply appropriate processing
- Query expansion for Bengali synonyms
- Preprocessing to handle different writing styles

**Current handling (basic implementation):**
- Basic language detection for query processing
- Standard vector similarity search with top-k retrieval
- Simple query preprocessing for Bengali text normalization

**What's missing (and badly needed):**
- **Confidence scoring:** No threshold filtering - system returns results even when they're probably wrong
- **Conversation memory:** Each query is processed independently, no context from previous questions
- **Fallback responses:** No graceful handling when retrieval confidence is low
- **Query validation:** Very short or vague queries (1-2 words) often return irrelevant chunks
- **Error handling:** Ambiguous pronouns in Bengali cause confusion with no fallback mechanism

---

### **Q: Do the results seem relevant? What might improve them?**

**A:** Honestly, the results are hit-or-miss. **60% accuracy** means 4 out of 10 questions still fail, which is frustrating for users.

**What works okay:**
- Simple factual questions like "কার নাম X?" get decent results
- When the PDF text quality is good, retrieval works better
- English queries surprisingly work better than expected

**What's really problematic:**

**1. OCR is the biggest bottleneck:**
- Current Tesseract setup misreads Bengali characters frequently
- Table layouts and complex formatting get completely mangled  
- Need to try **PaddleOCR** or **Google Vision API** - they handle Bengali much better than Tesseract
- Maybe even **manual digitization** for critical textbooks

**2. Embedding model limitations:**
- `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` wasn't trained on Bengali literature specifically
- Should experiment with **Sentence-BERT models fine-tuned on Bengali** 
- **BanglaBERT** embeddings might capture literary context better
- Consider training a **custom embedding model** on HSC textbooks and similar Bengali literature

**3. Chunking is naive:**
- Current character-based splitting breaks mid-context too often
- Need **semantic chunking** that understands when a topic changes
- **Paragraph-aware chunking** keeping related concepts together
- Maybe **recursive summarization** for better chunk representations

**4. LLM response quality:**
- Cohere/Ollama models don't understand Bengali literary nuances well
- **Custom fine-tuned models** on Bengali educational content would be ideal
- Even **GPT-4 with better Bengali prompting** might work better
- Need models that understand HSC-level Bengali academic context

**5. Domain-specific issues:**
- Literary analysis needs understanding of themes, not just facts
- Cultural references get lost completely
- **Domain-specific training data** (Bengali literature analysis) is essential

**Reality check:** This needs significant investment in better models, training data, and maybe even professional OCR services to get above 80% accuracy.
